# AboutTetris
This is a university project that consists of a website page purely in html and css.  
It is about the game Tetris and the project is in **Romanian** (as this was a requirement).  
All the provided informations (and images) are from [Tetris's Wikipedia Page](https://ro.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tetris).

# Content
The Index file is a 'home' page that contains all the provided chapters about the game, it also features a RGB and draggable Tetris header.
I've uncovered the game's history in 6 pages:
1. About - What is Tetris???
2. The Game - The origional game's rules and how it is supposed to be played.
3. History - How the author came with the idea and his first implementation of it.
4. Reception - About its popularity and success over the years.
5. Alternative Versions - About other game versions.
6. Demonstration - This would have been a very bare-bones version of the game made in JS (over a HTML Table) but I haven't got the time to finish it in time.
